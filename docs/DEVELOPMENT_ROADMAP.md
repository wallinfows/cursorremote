- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Latency**: < 100ms for chat submission
- **Uptime**: > 99.9% availability
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: < 2s page load time

### User Experience Metrics
- **Usability**: Intuitive mobile interface
- **Reliability**: Consistent chat delivery
- **Accessibility**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Cursor API Limitations**: Research integration points early
- **WebSocket Complexity**: Start with simple protocol, iterate
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize for mobile constraints
