# RemoteCursor Development Session Memory

## 🎯 Project Vision
**Northstar Goal**: Enable bilateral communication between Cursor and a remote mobile-based website, allowing management and submission of chats to Cursor on home computer when away.

**Success Criteria**:
- Submit new chats to Cursor from anywhere
- View and manage existing chat history
- Receive real-time updates from Cursor
- Maintain full Cursor AI assistance remotely

### Component Responsibilities
- **Desktop Agent**: Interfaces with Cursor's API/processes on home computer
- **WebSocket Bridge**: Real-time bidirectional communication layer
- **Mobile App**: Web-based mobile interface for remote access
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API documentation

## 📋 Session Progress Log

### Session 1 - Project Initialization ✅
**Date**: [Current Date]
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Explored workspace structure
- ✅ Established project vision and architecture
- ✅ Set up Git repository (cursorremote)
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Added .gitignore for Node.js development
- ✅ Pushed initial commit to GitHub: https://github.com/wallinfows/cursorremote

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Repository name: "cursorremote"
- GitHub hosting (authenticated as wallinfows)
- Project structure with 5 main directories
- Technology stack: Node.js-based components
- Communication protocol: WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication

**Next Session Goals**:
- [ ] Choose starting component (Desktop Agent, WebSocket Bridge, or Mobile App)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Initialize Node.js projects in component directories
- [ ] Begin component development

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Communication Protocol**: WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
2. **Mobile Interface**: Web-based (not native app) for cross-platform compatibility
3. **Desktop Integration**: Agent-based approach to interface with Cursor
4. **Hosting**: GitHub for version control and collaboration

### Technology Stack (Planned)
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (Socket.io or ws)
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for mobile web interface
- **Desktop**: Electron or Node.js process for Cursor integration
- **Authentication**: JWT or session-based
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for each component

## 🚧 Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Project Setup & Infrastructure
**Next Phase**: Component Development

## 📝 Notes & Ideas
- Consider Cursor's API limitations and integration points
- Plan for secure authentication between mobile and desktop
- Design for offline capability and sync when reconnected
- Consider mobile-first responsive design
- Plan for scalability and multiple user support

## 🔍 Research Needed
- [ ] Cursor's API documentation and integration points
- [ ] WebSocket security best practices
- [ ] Mobile web app performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility considerations

## 📊 Progress Metrics
- **Repository Setup**: 100% ✅
- **Documentation**: 80% ✅ (README complete, need component docs)
- **Architecture Design**: 90% ✅ (high-level complete, need detailed specs)
- **Development Environment**: 0% ⏳
- **Component Development**: 0% ⏳
- **Testing**: 0% ⏳
- **Deployment**: 0% ⏳
